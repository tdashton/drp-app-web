    Here you can manage your inventory. You have things you buy <em>(inventory)</em> and batches of inventory which you have actually bought <em>(supply)</em> - e.g. you have a keyring which you plan to buy then you buy 100 keyrings. First you have the plan to buy the keyring then you buy the actual keyring.
